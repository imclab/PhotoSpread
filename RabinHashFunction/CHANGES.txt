2.0 (June 15 2004)
Rewrite from scratch for better code clarity and documentation; API is not backwards compatible
Support for 64 bit hash functions
Now provides implementation of java.security.MessageDigestSpi for 32 and 64-bit hash functions
New and better JUnit tests
Better documentation
Hash functions objects implement Serializable and Cloneable now
Hash functions implement common methods like hashCode(), equals(), toString()
Removed some aspects of API and implementation deemed not useful
 Constructors are now public; classes no longer maintain a Map of their own instances
 No more internal private shared "buffer" for hash computations
Implementation is still thread-safe but now requires no synchronization

1.1 (November 18 2001)
Added support for JDK 1.4 ByteBuffer and IntBuffer
Added support for hashing arrays of chars
Slight performance improvements
Revamped API for better memory efficiency
Added RabinHashFunctionTest class
