This subdirectory allows us to test .jj files when we try to change
the formula language. Subdirectory photoSpreadParser/ needs to contain
the .jj file to be tested. Every file in this subdirectory, other than
the .jj file can be deleted. They are generated by the javacc parser
generator. Among others, that generator produces ExpressionParser,
which has a 'main' method for testing.

The sub-sub-directory photoSpreadParser/parseTestSkeleton/ contains
stub versions of the PhotoSpread files that are required when running
the ExpressionParser main program.

The only change in a .jj file that is required to transplant it into
this test harness is to:

    1. comment out 'import photoSpreadParser.photoSpreadExpression.*;'
    2. add 'import parseTestSkeleton.*;'

After that substitution, three steps are required:

    0. Set up Classpath:

       setenv CLASSPATH ".;C:\\Program Files\\JavaSoft\\JRE\\1.3.1_15\\libt\\QTJava.zip:e\\users\\paepcke\\dldev\\src\\PhotoSpreadTesting\\FormulaLanguageTests"

    1. Generate the parser files:

        cd e/users/paepcke/dldev/src/PhotoSpreadTesting/FormulaLanguageTests
        ~/Software/Java/JavaCC/javacc-4.1/bin/javacc PhotoSpreadParser_5.jj

    2. Compile the resulting files:
        
        cd ..
	javac photoSpreadParser/*.java

    3. Run tests:

        java photoSpreadParser/ExpressionParser <test formulas>
