To do:

- Cut new version.

    * Controlling the number of rows and columns: 

       - Method 0: just start PhotoSpread, and a spreadsheet with a
           default number of 10 rows and 9 columns is created.

       - Method 1: use command line options
           Options are -r or --sheetNumRows for the number of
           rows. Use -c or --sheetNumCols for 
	   the number of columns. Example:
               java -jar spreadsheet-....jar -c 8
           will create a spreadsheet with 8 colums
               java -jar spreadsheet-....jar --sheetNumCols 8
           is equivalent to the first example, and will create 8
	   columns. 
	       java -jar spreadsheet-....jar -r 20
	       java -jar spreadsheet-....jar --sheetNumRows 20
           are similarly equivalent, and will create 20 rows.
	   Both, row and column specifications may be provided:
               java -jar spreadsheet-....jar -r 20 -c 5
           creates a sheet with 20 rows and 3 columns.

        - Method 2: Use a configuration file:
           A file $HOME/.photoSpread/photoSpread.properties
           can contain properties that are in effect when command line
           options are given. Example content for this file:

	      sheetNumCols = 3
	      sheetNumRows = 20

           Command line options will override the properties set in
           this file.

- New release 0.91
    * Importing .csv now offers to write to Exif at end of import.
    * New cell context menu item: Clear Exif data from all photos in current cell.
    * New cell context menu items: Can lock and unlock Exif in all photos of one cell.
    * Reworked UUID checking for both csv import and XML loading of entire sheet.
    * Added file re-navigation for case when importing photos to a new
      machine fails, because the photos are in a different place than on
      the original machine. 
    * Command line option -r or --sheetNumRows takes a number of desired rows.
      Command line option -c or --sheetNumCols takes a number of desired rows.
    * Fixed bug of formula cells not being updated upon drag of
      objects into another
      formula. (http://code.google.com/p/photospread/issues/detail?id=21) 
    * Added command line and property file control over the number of
      rows and columns.
